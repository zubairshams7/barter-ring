# barter-ring
barter-ring allows for unlimited cyclic bartering instead of traditional two way exchange

Barter items in cycles. Instead of traditional two way bartering system, barter-ring allows for cyclic bartering. Say Sarah (X) has something John (Y) wants. Therefore, X -> Y means Sarah transfers an item to John. barter-ring allows for X -> Y, Y -> Z and Z -> X where ring size is 3. Works for unlimited ring size.
