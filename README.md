# barter-ring
barter-ring allows for unlimited cyclic bartering instead of traditional two way exchange. It's based on the idea of Wish list and Give list. Every person wants things in their Wish list and willing to part with some items in the Give list. But instead of matching people 1 -1 for exchanges, barter-ring forms a ring of exchanges thus vastly increasing the chance of finding items in your Wish list. 

How does barter-ring forms a ring? Here's an example. Say Sarah (X) has something John (Y) wants. Therefore, X -> Y means Sarah transfers an item to John and Y -> X means John transfers an item to Sarah, a traditional bartering exchange. barter-ring allows for X -> Y, Y -> Z and Z -> X forming a ring between X, Y and Z where everybody gets something they want. In this particular instance, the ring size is 3. barter-ring Works for unlimited ring size exponentially increasing the likelihood of discovering what you want, and giving what you don't want but someone else does. 

The application is written in C#.
